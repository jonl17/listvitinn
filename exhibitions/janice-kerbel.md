  If Janice Kerbel’s medium is language and other abstract systems, her implied
  one is the human body.


  Each of the large-scale silkscreen prints in her series Brawl (2018) consists
  of verbs and nouns printed in different fonts and deployed, sometimes almost
  strewn, across a portrait-orientated paper. Not only action words, but
  brusquely violent ones: jab, grab, head butt, punch, push, barge and straddle,
  to name but a few. The scale of the paper echoes the human body, or the space
  of a body, and the prints, with the words printed in the pictorial space as if
  in the space of a fight, could be either a set of commands from an unseen
  choreographer or the narration of an event, live or fictional. The viewer
  experiences a gap between an abstract pattern of signs and the slapstick
  physicality of what they signify, or attempt to signify. The result is a
  lingering absence.


  Kerbel’s Sink (2018) prints produce a similar effect. Treating the shape and
  surface of the paper as if it were a rectangular pool, there are small,
  abstracted human forms that represent individual swimmers that through
  repetition become a pattern. The marks inhabit the space in a range of
  different positions, shapes and densities, small parts of an overall whole
  that takes on its own distinct character. The figures might have their
  precise, arrow-like arms pushed forward, or their legs spread like the arms of
  a compass, or they might fold up into a tiny, geometric mark of black ink. The
  small, incorporeal forms refer to fleshy bodies immersed in water, an implied
  sensual abundance. 


  Both Brawl and Sink have an austere presence despite describing the
  potentially chaotic actions of imperfect bodies. Yet fights and swims have
  their own abstract systems and conventions: the words ‘upper cut’ on one of
  the Brawl prints describes a motion that is formal and practiced, if delivered
  in a particular way at a particular time. Synchronised swimming is, of course,
  highly formalised: the sport’s appeal lies in the symmetrical, timed routines
  which seems to defy nature. Both sets of prints trigger in the viewer’s
  imagination this discrepancy between abstract systems and the particular
  bodies – and events – they might activate. 


  But we return to looking at the works on paper as objects, as bodies with
  their own properties of position, weight and tactility: in Brawl, we see the
  depth and solidity of the ink, the ridged edges of the letterforms, detect the
  increased thickness where letters overlap. In Sink, Kerbel is alert to the
  qualities of the paper, printing on both sides, exploiting the subtle
  translucency to suggest submersion, with the surface of the paper acting as
  the surface of the water. Each of the Sink prints are hand-stamped,
  introducing the inexact gestures of the artist’s body.


  Kerbel starts by looking into the gap between abstract signs and the actions
  they signify, and pushes that space open even further. Sink and Brawl demand a
  response from the viewer: you smash and shove your own imagination, grapple
  with the question of how, engaged by any human consciousness, immaterial ideas
  can conjure vivid bodily form.
