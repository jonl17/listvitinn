  Anna Guðjónsdóttir sýnir nýtt verk í mörgum hlutum sem tekur yfir allan
  sýningarsalinn. Listsköpun Önnu á rætur í málverkahefðinni þar sem tekist er á
  við sígildar spurningar um mörk tvívíðs, málaðs flatar og þrívíðs,
  raunverulegs rýmis – mörk frummyndar og eftirmyndar. Anna kallar fram
  hugmyndir sínar með tilvísun í landslag og byggingarlist ásamt því að styðjast
  við form sýningarskápa. Á sýningunni Hluti í stað heildar umbreytist
  sýningarsalurinn í nokkurs konar sýningarskáp sem gestir ganga inn í, umvafðir
  málverkum sem spegla rýmið sjálft og opna jafnframt inn í aðra og ófyrirséða
  heima. 


  Undanfarin ár hefur listamönnum verið boðið að takast á við A-sal
  Hafnarhússins með nýjum innsetningum. Arkítektúr salarins einkennist af
  voldugum súlum hins gamla vöruhúss og stórum gluggum sem fylla upp í gömlu
  hleðsludyrnar. Skemmst er að minnast sýninga Ingólfs Arnarssonar, Jarðhæð
  (2018), Ilmar Stefánsdóttur, Panik (2017) og Moniku Grzymala, Hugboð (2016).
  Allar kölluðust þær með ólíkum hætti á við umhverfið. Í kjölfar sýningar Önnu
  Guðjónsdóttur sýnir Finnbogi Pétursson nýja innsetningu í sama sal. 


  Anna Guðjónsdóttir (f. 1958) er fædd og uppalin í Reykjavík. Eftir tveggja ára
  nám í höggmyndadeild Myndlista- og handíðaskóla Íslands fór hún til Þýskalands
  í myndlistarnám við Listaháskóla Hamborgar þaðan sem hún brautskráðist árið
  1992. Anna hefur hlotið margvísleg verðlaun á alþjóðavettvangi fyrir myndlist
  sína. Hún hefur haldið sýningar víðs vegar um heim en nokkuð er um liði frá
  því hún sýndi síðast á Íslandi. Anna er búsett í Hamborg en er alltaf með
  annan fótinn hér á landi.

  Anna Guðjónsdóttir: Pars pro toto


  Anna Guðjónsdóttir shows a new work in multiple parts that takes over the
  gallery space. Guðjónsdóttir‘s art is deeply rooted in painting, reflecting
  classic questions on the divide between two-dimensional, painted surface and
  three-dimensional, real space – the boundary between the original and the
  copy. Guðjónsdóttir brings these questions about by way of landscape and
  architecture as well as referring to the shape of the exhibition vitrine. In
  her exhibition, Pars pro toto, the gallery becomes a vitrine of sorts,
  accessible by viewers. They are surrounded by paintings reflecting the space
  itself as well as opening up other unforeseen dimensions.


  In recent years artists have been invited to take on the A-Gallery of
  Reykjavík Art Museum’s Hafnarhús. The gallery’s architecture is characterized
  by heavy columns of this former warehouse and large windows filling up the
  gaps of the old loading doors. Recent exhibitions include Ingólfur
  Arnarsson‘s, Ground Level (2018), Ilmur Stefánsdóttir‘s, Panik (2017) and
  Monika Grzymala‘s, Envoi (2016). All embraced the surroundings in an
  exceptional way. Following Anna Guðjónsdóttir’s exhibition it is Finnbogi
  Pétursson’s turn.


  Anna Guðjónsdóttir (b. 1958) was born and raised in Reykjavík, Iceland. After
  studying in the sculpting department of The Icelandic College of Art and
  Crafts for two years, she moved to Germany to study at the University of Fine
  Arts in Hamburg, graduating in 1992. She has received numerous awards for her
  work, both in Iceland and abroad. She has held exhibitions internationally but
  it has been a while since her last show in Iceland. She currently lives and
  works in Hamburg.
