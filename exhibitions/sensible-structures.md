  Sensible Structures

  30. 03. 2019 - 26. 05. 2019
   
  Sensible Structures explores the conceptual relationships that occur in the
  parenthesis between the visual and the verbal. This ekphrasis will be
  conceived in spatial form through sculpture, video, sound installation, and
  painting through the work of Kristinn Már Pálmason (1967) and Bryndís Hrönn
  Ragnarsdóttir (1974) and geometric drawings by the late Fluxus artist Ludwig
  Gosewitz (1936 – 2007) to create an allegory of the simultaneity of language
  and vision. The exhibition will see the release of the publication, Sensible
  Structures, relating the artists' work to the ekphrasis of medieval alchemical
  manuscripts. Curated by Erin Honeycutt.
