  Louder Than Bombs is a group exhibition by three painters who engage closely
  as a group but who all work individually. The theme of the show is silence.
  This is then silence as something that opens up – not closes down or hides
  away. The sense and sensibility of silence as a way to create room for
  something that is yet not there, something that is about to emerge.


  It is a silence that is generated and maintained in order to provide time and
  space for the other to enter and to engage, saying: please, please, you first,
  I will listen, and listen with care and carefulness. It is an invitation, both
  for the artist’s situated gestures and especially for the viewers, to
  participate in a visual anticipation and experience that brings together and
  brings about a notion of togetherness that is not forced, but felt for.


  Louder Than Bombs is the effect that grows out of a painting show in which all
  works are done for this site and this show, in which all works relate to each
  other but are individuals. The set-up is rather minimal and quiet, trusting
  the notion that less is more. It is a group show that connects the dots
  between the private and the public, the personal and the general by linking
  memories of the past with the vision of a future of how to be and behave
  together.


  Seeing with and being both in and through a particular sense of time and
  place, you have the slightest of the slightest touch of color and light in the
  over-imposed paintings by Birgir Snæbjörn Birgisson, you have the cryptic but
  intensively clear vast skyscapes of Miikka Vaskola, and you have the porous
  and playful touch in the canvases of Heidi Lampenius – altogether coming
  together as a whole that is more, much more than a sum of its parts.


  It is silence as an embrace, a quiet but willful willingness to risk the
  opening up for something we sense that we crave for but don’t know what it is.
  This type of a silence is active, not passive, it is not esoteric, not
  mystical but stands for nearness, face-to-face consultations and also
  confrontations that do not suffocate but allow us to go deeper into the
  matters that really do matter – matters that are defined by this intertwined
  dual notion: 1) there is nothing wrong with being kind and 2) we should trust
  the nowadays often somehow lost notion that we are able to rely on the
  kindness of strangers.
